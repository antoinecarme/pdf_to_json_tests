These are PDF files for each language for which the UDHR text is made available by the unicode.org team. Almost all "modern" unicode scripts are represented here.

For each language we generate some pdf files by using multiple fonts (tool : wkhtmltopdf).

Language names are of the form 'Script.Language' where 'Script' is the 4 letter [ISO 15924 Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924)  of the script used and 'Language' is the 3 letter [ISO 639-3 Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) pof the language variant. For example : Cyrl.SRP and Latn.SRP are the codes for serbian languages written with cyrillic script and latin script respectively.

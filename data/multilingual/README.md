These are PDF files for each language for which the UDHR text is made available by the unicode.org team. Almost all "modern" unicode scripts are represented here.

For each language we generate some pdf files by using multiple fonts (tool : wkhtmltopdf).

Thanks to https://github.com/unicode-org/udhr for the texts of the UDHR.
Thanks to https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf for the html to pdf converter
